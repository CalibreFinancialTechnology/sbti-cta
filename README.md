# SBTi Company Taking Actions Data Repository

This repository hosts the most current version of the "Companies Taking Actions" spreadsheet,

## Overview
The SBTi (Science Based Targets initiative) website uses a Web Application Firewall (WAF) which blocks automated tasks from downloading their files. 
To make the data readily available, we manually download the file on a regular basis and upload it here.

## Directory Structure
The spreadsheet file is located at the root level of this repository, and is named `companies-taking-action.xlsx`.
